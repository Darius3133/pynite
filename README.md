## 🚀 Getting started

### 1. Download Python
1. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. Download the Windows installer or the Python install manager (I recommend the Install manager because the legacy installer will be deprecated).
3. Install the PySide6 library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install PySide6
   ```
*(If you don't have the environment paths set up properly on Windows, go to `C:\Users\(YOURUSERNAME)\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python(version)\Scripts` and run pip from there as it's an executable).*

### 2. Download Pynite
1. Go to the releases.
2. Download whatever version of Pynite you want.

### 3. Running Pynite
1. Run the Python script from the location you put Pynite in. That's it.
